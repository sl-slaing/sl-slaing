I'm **Simon Laing**, a Lead Developer and so much more!

I've predominatly worked with *dotnet* (Framework and core), but also with *Java* to name but a few. I've worked as a Lead Developer since 2012 leading teams of various sizes and projects of various natures. I've worked with Open Source projects, personal and 'professional' all with the aim of supporting myself and others through our industry.

I pride myself on many aspects, some of the key ones are listed below:
- **Quality** - High-quality codes improves reliability, correctness and flexibility. It is the yard-stick by which i measure myself.
- **Efficiency** - Delivery of work in a *timely manner*, *without cutting corners*
- **Longevity** - What we produce needs to be *maintainable*, *supportable* and stand up to the trials and tribulations of life.

I'm not a 'standard' developer, I place great importance in understanding the project, the business and the team to help ensure the most effective delivery possible. 
I've got experience in architectural design, testing practice, CI/CD pipelines, to name but a few...
